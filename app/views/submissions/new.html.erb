    <p>Select the appropriate answer for your current status and target (where you would like to get to).</p>
    <p>For example for the question "We have the required technical infrastructure and tools to meet digital objectives", you may feel that the organisation currently lacks the appropriate infrastructure and tools, and it is something the organisation should have in future, but it's not top priority. If that is the case you might choose "strongly disagree" for your current status and "agree" for your target.</p>
    <p>Remember that your target state is not your ideal state. It is a realistic target of where you would like to be given your resources, time and priorities.</p>
